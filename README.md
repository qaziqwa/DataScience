A Data Scientist combines statistical and machine learning techniques with Python programming to analyze and interpret complex data.

Data Science Journey walks through Data Science Competitions in an attempt to gain expertise of machine learning algortihms and tools.

# 1. Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

### 1.1 Objective
Predict survival on the Titanic

### 1.2 Competition Description

The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.

One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

In this challenge, you have to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, you have to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

# 2. Digit Recognizer

### 2.1 Objective
The goal in this competition is to take an image of a handwritten single digit, and determine what that digit is.
For every ImageId in the test set, you should predict the correct label. 

### 2.2 Competition Description

MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

In this competition, the goal is to correctly identify digits from a dataset of tens of thousands of handwritten images.

### 2.3 Practice Skills

    Computer vision fundamentals including simple neural networks

    Classification methods such as SVM and K-nearest neighbors

### 2.4 Metric
This competition is evaluated on the categorization accuracy of your predictions (the percentage of images you get correct).
